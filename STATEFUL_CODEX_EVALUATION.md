# Stateful Codex evaluation record

This record distinguishes implemented behavior from demonstrated product
advantage. `STATEFUL_CODEX_PRODUCT_INTENT.md` defines the outcome being tested;
component tests and a runnable interface are necessary, but are not evidence
that Stateful Codex is better than ordinary Codex.

## Evaluation method

`clients/stateful-codex/eval/compare-rollouts.mjs` compares two rollout JSONL
files. It refuses to treat a pair as comparable unless originator, source,
model, reasoning effort, approval and sandbox policy, permission profile,
working directory, workspace roots, and normalized user prompt all match. It
reports full lifetime usage separately from uncached usage, checks predeclared
answer terms, and counts read-bearing tool calls plus Stateful retrieval and
persistence calls.

Read-bearing tool calls are a rollout-level proxy. They are not an exact count
of operating-system reads, and a single call may perform multiple operations.
Token totals are the final cumulative totals recorded by Codex, not estimates
from text length.

## Benchmark SC-EVAL-001: trivial exact directory inventory

Date: 2026-09-21

Question: does accumulated project intelligence reduce work or token cost on a
small task whose answer is cheap to verify directly?

The ordinary and Stateful runs used:

- TUI originator and CLI source;
- `gpt-5.6-luna` with `xhigh` reasoning effort;
- `danger-full-access` sandbox policy;
- the exact same selected directory;
- the exact same prompt; and
- cached Codex ChatGPT login, with no API key required.

Prompt:

```text
Count-regular-files-in-this-selected-directory-not-recursively-report-exact-total-and-group-every-filename-by-extension-do-not-edit-verify-from-filesystem
```

Rollouts:

- ordinary Codex: `01a0c60b-3489-7d72-96ae-54c1eb632a0a`
- Stateful Codex: `01a0c608-945f-7d42-a6d5-e889d4d6f19c`

The expected result was registered as the exact count plus all eight filenames.
Both runs returned the correct total, extension grouping, and filenames, and
both stated that no files were edited.

| Measure | Ordinary | Stateful | Stateful change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Full input tokens | 68,968 | 84,145 | +15,177 |
| Cached input tokens | 47,360 | 52,736 | +5,376 |
| Uncached input tokens | 21,608 | 31,409 | +9,801 |
| Output tokens | 932 | 1,332 | +400 |
| Full lifetime tokens | 69,900 | 85,477 | +15,577 (+22.28%) |
| Uncached input + output | 22,540 | 32,741 | +10,201 (+45.26%) |
| Model responses | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| Read-bearing tool calls | 2 | 1 | -1 (-50%) |

Stateful also made one blackboard query, one obligation update, and one run
update. It did not need a context-map query for this task.

### Interpretation

This is a negative token-efficiency result. Stateful Codex reduced the number
of read-bearing tool calls, but the saved read was much cheaper than the added
project context, tools, reasoning, and semantic persistence. The benchmark is
below the expected break-even point for durable project intelligence: direct
verification of eight filenames is already trivial.

One paired run is not enough to attribute the entire token difference to a
specific context fragment or to estimate a stable percentage. It is enough to
reject any claim that Stateful is already cheaper for every task. The product
should preserve semantic continuity without pretending that memory is free.

### Remediation rerun SC-EVAL-001R

After binding model-facing Stateful tools to the selected thread's active run,
the exact benchmark was rerun through the rebuilt native CLI. The new Stateful
rollout is `01a0c64c-e23b-7333-beec-32603b4d8eb0`. The comparator confirmed
full parity with the ordinary rollout across entry point, model, reasoning,
permissions, selected directory, workspace roots, and prompt. Both answers
again contained the exact total and every expected filename.

The remediation achieved its reliability goal: `steering_query`,
`obligation_update`, and `stateful_run_update` no longer accepted or received a
model-authored `runId`. The live run completed its obligation and run update
without the malformed-ID failure seen in the previous diagnostic run. It used
one read-bearing call and made no blackboard or context-map query for this
cheap-to-verify task.

| Measure | Ordinary | Remediated Stateful | Stateful change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Full input tokens | 68,968 | 128,712 | +59,744 |
| Cached input tokens | 47,360 | 99,328 | +51,968 |
| Uncached input tokens | 21,608 | 29,384 | +7,776 |
| Output tokens | 932 | 1,539 | +607 |
| Full lifetime tokens | 69,900 | 130,251 | +60,351 (+86.34%) |
| Uncached input + output | 22,540 | 30,923 | +8,383 (+37.19%) |
| Model responses | 3 | 5 | +2 |
| Read-bearing tool calls | 2 | 1 | -1 (-50%) |

This remains a negative efficiency result. Uncached input plus output improved
from 32,741 in the first Stateful run to 30,923 in the remediated run, but the
model used separate responses for steering, source verification, obligation
publication, run completion, and the final answer. The resulting cached-context
replays made full lifetime usage worse. A single rerun cannot separate prompt
effects from model sampling variance; it does show that removing opaque run IDs
fixed the observed reliability failure without establishing a token advantage.

## Live interface validation

The evaluation surface has also been exercised through both supported product
paths:

- Native CLI: the branch CLI built successfully; five Stateful TUI tests and
  snapshots passed; and a fresh real cached-login run completed as
  `01a0c64c-e23b-7333-beec-32603b4d8eb0` without API keys or source edits. Its
  selected-directory answer was exact, and its active-run tools required no
  model-authored run ID.
- Browser client: a rendered client was exercised against the real local
  gateway, branch app-server, branch CLI, and cached login. The run covered
  creating, continuing, and forking threads; exact evidence inspection;
  Socratic execution gating; pause/resume; and reload recovery. A fresh run on
  the remediated package created thread
  `01a0c646-d8f7-7571-b398-e77f423b429d`, surfaced the known Windows host-shell
  failure and approval recovery, then displayed the correct semantic obligation
  and completed result. Its screenshots are under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Temp/stateful-client-smoke-1790032608507`.

The browser-client suite passes 5/5. Building its code-mode companion locally
on Windows used the matching `v150.4.0` archive and generated binding from the
published Codex `rusty-v8-v150.4.0` release because the upstream crate's default
sandbox archive URL returns 404. This was a local artifact override, not a
dependency or source change.

These checks demonstrate operability, not comparative product advantage.

## Open release evidence

The Stage 8 release claim remains open until representative paired scenarios
measure the outcomes the product exists to improve:

1. knowledge precision and recall after multiple turns and compaction;
2. reduced repeated source reading and lifetime cost in a mature workspace;
3. recovery of a decisive detail and a non-obvious cross-source connection;
4. steering acknowledgement and application latency;
5. unattended autonomous completion and restart recovery; and
6. final-claim correctness, freshness, and traceability to exact evidence.

Each scenario must predeclare its expected facts or decisions, use matched
ordinary/Stateful conditions where comparison is meaningful, preserve negative
results, and avoid turning component success into a product-level claim.
